# Games_Sales_Strategy_SQL_Tableau

In this project, I tackled the challenges faced by gaming companies in a fiercely competitive market. Recognizing the significance of comprehending player preferences and market trends, I delved into a dataset armed with the power of SQL and Tableau. Through SQL, I meticulously prepared and cleansed the data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. Subsequently, I harnessed the visualization capabilities of Tableau to transform raw data into meaningful insights. By addressing critical problems, I provided valuable strategic guidance to navigate the complexities of the gaming industry successfully.
